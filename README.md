# DE Python Tests

> For interviews in 2022 JTA.

This test is to assess your ability to write Python code and to discuss how you think about coding problems during the interview. Failing to fully complete the test is not a failure of the interview.

If needed, there is a person you can contact to clarify questions or solve technical issues. If anything is unclear or you are not sure if something is wrong, please ask them as soon as possible. Asking questions will not affect how we score you on the test, so it is better to ask sooner rather than later.

You are free to use the internet to solve these tests and you can install additional packages. However, the solutions to this test can be achieved using Python and its standard libraries. We encourage you to use whatever you're most comfortable with. This coding test was written and tested with python 3.8.

## Doing the Tests

There are 3 scripts in the root of this repo/directory:

- test_1.py
- test_2.py
- test_3.py

These scripts do not need to be completed in order, however we do recommend you do.

Within each script there will be a comment block starting with `[TODO]` which lays out what needs to be done to solve the test for that particular script. The remaining comments are there to explain the code and help direct you.

### Test 1
When you think you have the answer, run `python test_1.py` and it will be automatically tested.

### Test 2
We will ask you to show your solution during the interview where you can also discuss your solution.

### Test 3
We will ask you to show your solution during the interview where you can also discuss your solution.

If you have any questions or technical issues please use the contact details provided. They are here to help and asking questions will not affect how your interview is assessed.
